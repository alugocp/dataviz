<h2>why it was built</h2>
  <p> datadrop was created in order to aggregate a list of collected databases in
  order for researchers to find obscure or lesser known data more easily.
  In this way, individuals can pull up Internet sourced data based on keyword
  searches they type in. </p>
  <p>Fast, easy, efficient––that's <b> datadrop</b>.</p>
<h2>how it was done</h2>
  <p> datadrop was constructed using several methods, including Node, Javascript,
    Web Static, and Bootstrap. HTML and CSS were implemented for the look of site. </p>
